Hello, this is our project called "LandCangeComparision" or LCC. This project was written in 2 days and it already looks good, but believe me, if you give us more time, we have a lot of ideas in our heads on how to implement it better, but the deadlines are running out. We can implement what we promised at the presentation if you give us more time..Our project allows you enter the country in the search bar, then data for the current time will be displayed, further down the line you enter the year about the information you want to know, then you click on the button and a comparison is displayed our gmail:notokcrash111@gmail.com
